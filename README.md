## How It's Made:
This is a full-stack MERN application.  React handles our front end and updating our components.  Node and Express are responsible for communications from the front end and effecting our changes on MongoDB where our database is hosted.

Organization is the key to success.  Being aware of what parts of individual projects you are responsible for is key.  In addition to this you can triage them by when they are due or how long you estimate them to take.
